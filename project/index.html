			<header><h3>Introduction</h3></header>

			<p>
				<a href="flightgear.org">FlightGear</a> is an open source flight simulator.  My project website
				is <a href="flightgearcanada.altervista.org">FlightGear Canada</a>.  This is one of several regional
				portals in the flightgear community.  The general goal of each is to provide a site where local users
				and developers can share, discuss and download local subjects.  I took over as the administrator for
				FlightGear Canada in January.  Since then I have been redeveloping the site from scratch to replace the
				<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/flightgearcanada/">existing</a> bare bones site, using skills
				learned in this course and previous courses.

			<p>
				This website was developed entirely by myself, within the timeline of this course.  The site contains
				content (3D models, models textures, and thumbnails) developed by other members of the FlightGear community.
				It also makes use of the following libraries:

				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://code.google.com/p/hangar/">Hangar</a> - Renders AC3D format 3D models on HTML canvas element</li>
					<li>Screenshots</li>
				</ul>
