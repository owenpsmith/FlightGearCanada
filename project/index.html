			<header><h3>Introduction</h3></header>
			<p>
				<a href="http://flightgear.org">FlightGear</a> is an open source flight simulator.  My project website
				is <a href="http://flightgearcanada.altervista.org">FlightGear Canada</a>.  This is one of several regional
				portals in the flightgear community.  The general goal of each is to provide a site where local users
				and developers can share, discuss and download local subjects.  I took over as the administrator for
				FlightGear Canada in January.  Since then I have been redeveloping the site from scratch to replace the
				<a href="http://sites.google.com/site/flightgearcanada/">existing</a> bare bones site, using skills
				learned in this course and previous courses.  Testing was performed primarily on Firefox and iPhone Safari.

			<header><h3>Credits</h3></header>
			<p>
				This website was developed entirely by myself, within the timeline of this course.  The site contains
				content (3D models, models textures, and thumbnails) developed by other members of the FlightGear community.
				It also makes use of the following libraries:
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://github.com/jcmellado/hangar">Hangar</a> - Renders AC3D format 3D models on HTML canvas element</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.jssor.com">Jssor.Slider</a> - Slideshow library</li>
					<li>Expandable list - Library to provide expandable list functionality, can't find origin now :-O</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

				The pages which compose this course project are:
				<ul>
					<li><b>Aircraft</b> - Index to all available Canadian manufactured aircraft, with links to 3D viewer</li>
					<li><b>Liveries</b> - Index to all available liveries (paint scheme textures) for Canadian based operators, with links to 3D viewer</li>
					<li><b>Screenshots</b> - Thumbnail gallery and slideshow for screenshots of Canadian subjects in FlightGear</li>
					<li><b>Map</b> - Google map showing location of developers, users, enhanced scenery/airport projects, and favorite airports</li>
				</ul>

			<header><h3>Issues</h3></header>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Expandable lists only work when you click on the '+', need to make it work by clicking on name</li>
					<li>3D models sometimes have refresh issues.  Clicking on another tab and back serves as a workaround but need to look into this more.</li>
					<li>Edit 3D models to enhance loading performance (DC-3 is VERY slow) and fix clipping frame issue (model parts colliding, creating interference patterns</li>
					<li>Improve transitions to reduce flickering between elements, site wide issue</li>
				</ul>
