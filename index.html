			<header><h3>Jan 25, 2015 - New administrator</h3></header>
			<p>Bob Maheu has moved on after initially developing this site and maintaining it for the past several years.  He has handed ownership of the
			site to me and I will maintain it for the forseeable future.  Over the next few months, I will migrate the site away from Google sites and restructure
			it.  Please let me know if there is anything you would like to see on the new site and I will try to incorporate it.  Drop me a line at owenpsmith@shaw.ca.
